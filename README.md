# Project Overview
The project is an Arduino program that reads temperature, humidity, pressure, and altitude data from a DHT22 sensor and BMP180 sensor, and prints the readings to the serial monitor.

## Dependencies
The project uses the following libraries:

Wire.h
Adafruit_Sensor.h
Adafruit_BMP085.h
DHT.h
## Installation
Install the Arduino IDE
Connect the DHT22 sensor and BMP180 sensor to the Arduino board
Install the necessary libraries using the Library Manager in the Arduino IDE
Upload the program to the Arduino board
## Usage
Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE
Wait for the program to initialize the sensors
The readings for temperature, humidity, pressure, and altitude will be displayed in the Serial Monitor
The program will continue to update the readings every 2 seconds
